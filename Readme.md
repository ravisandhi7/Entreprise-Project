📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete Enterprise Active Directory environment built using virtual machines. It simulates a real-world corporate network with multiple domain controllers, organizational units, group policies, and automation using PowerShell.

The lab is designed to showcase system administration, identity management, and enterprise network configuration skills.

🎯 Objectives
Deploy and configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
Implement multi-domain controller architecture
Configure DNS and DHCP services
Create and manage Organizational Units (OUs), Users, and Groups
Automate user creation using PowerShell
Apply Group Policies (GPOs)
Test replication and domain functionality
🖥️ Lab Environment
Virtual Machines
Machine	Role	IP Address
DC1	Primary Domain Controller	10.0.0.10
DC2	Additional Domain Controller	10.0.0.11
RODC	Read-Only Domain Controller	10.0.0.12
Client	Windows 10/11	DHCP
Network Configuration
Internal Network / Host-Only Adapter
DNS handled by DC1
DHCP configured on DC1
🏗️ Architecture
DC1 → AD DS, DNS, DHCP
DC2 → Additional Domain Controller (Replication)
RODC → Read-Only Domain Controller
Client Machine → Domain-joined workstation
